Here is all my projects webpage:https://activebook.github.io/
I wanna you help me to make it cool and elegant.
because it host on github pages,so you can't add a lot of interactive elements.
but you can use html,css,js to make it cool.
and because every project has their own screenshots, so i think you can use css to make it more elegant.

**Important:**

1, don't write css your own, just use any cool css framework.
2, don't write pure js, just use js framework.
